Homeplate is a web-based application that provides database and scheduling support
for a food distribution organization in South Carolina.

Installation: Homeplate runs on an Apache/MySQL/PHP server.  To install it, visit the
project Wiki at https://github.com/megandalster/sh-homeplate/wiki/installation-and-reuse/.

For more details on using Homepate as a project for a CO-FOSS course, visit this site:

Usage: Homeplate can run stand-alone or it can be used in conjunction with Homeplate.mobile, 
an Android app that allows drivers to record and upload weights of food pickups and dropoffs 
on their truck routes.  Homeplate can also be embedded in a web browser for easy user access.

Credits: Homeplate was developed in 2012 by Hartley Brody, Richardo Hopkins, 
Nicholas Wetzel, and Allen Tucker.  Since then, it has been significantly upgraded 
and is currently maintained by NPFI (https://npfi.org).
