Homeplate is a web-based application that provides database and scheduling support
for a food distribution organization in South Carolina.

Installation: Homeplate runs on an Apache/MySQL/PHP server.  To install it, 

1.  download the source code to your root directory, 

2.  create a MySQL database "homeplatedb" on localhost with user "homeplatedb"
and password "homeplatedb".

3.  Import the database named "homeplatedb" from the directory docs.google.com/ into the
database you created in step 2.

4.  Set your browser to your root directory/sh-homeplate.  You should see the Homeplate
login screen.  

5.  Login with Admin1234567890 (same password) to get full administrative access to 
Homeplate functionality.

Usage: Homeplate can run stand-alone or it can be used in conjunction with Homeplate.mobile, 
an Android app that allows drivers to record and upload weights of food pickups and dropoffs 
on their truck routes.  To download, install, and run Homeplate.mobile together with Homeplate,
see the README at https://github.com/megandalster/Homeplate.mobile.
